At the front-end, PassLink leverages the power of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing users to easily navigate and interact with their stored passwords and associated information. On the back-end, PassLink utilizes Express, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, to handle server-side logic and API endpoints. The heart of PassOP lies in its MongoDB database, which serves as a secure and scalable storage solution for user credentials.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Made it fully responsive so that user can use on any device and save their passwords on the go! Finally deployed it using vercel.
